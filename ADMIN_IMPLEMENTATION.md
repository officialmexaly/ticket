# Admin CRUD Permissions Implementation

## Overview
I have implemented comprehensive admin CRUD permissions for your ticket management system. Admins now have full access to all resources and can perform any operation on tickets, users, organizations, and other system data.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context Updates (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- Added `is_super_admin` field to UserProfile interface
- Added `isSuperAdmin` to AuthContextType
- Updated `isAdmin` logic to check both `is_admin` and `is_super_admin`
- Admin users now have access if either flag is true

### 2. Database Schema Updates (`fix-admin-permissions.sql`)
- Added `is_admin` column to `user_profiles` table for backward compatibility
- Created comprehensive admin permission functions:
  - `user_is_admin()` - checks if user has admin privileges
  - `user_has_admin_access()` - checks comprehensive admin access
- Added RLS policies giving admins full CRUD access to ALL resources:
  - All tickets (create, read, update, delete)
  - All user profiles (read, update)
  - All organizations and memberships
  - All voice notes and drafts
  - All ticket comments
- Created `admin_dashboard_view` for admin statistics

### 3. API Route Enhancements
#### Updated Existing Routes
- `app/api/tickets/route.js`: Added proper authentication, removed admin bypass
- `app/api/tickets/[id]/route.js`: Uses RLS policies instead of bypassing them

#### New Admin-Only Routes
- `app/api/admin/users/route.js`: User management (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- `app/api/admin/tickets/route.js`: Advanced ticket management with filters

### 4. Admin Dashboard Enhancements (`components/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- Updated to use new user profile structure with `is_admin` and `is_super_admin`
- Added role management with three levels:
  - **User**: No admin privileges
  - **Admin**: Full access to organization resources
  - **Super Admin**: Full system-wide access
- Enhanced UI with proper role badges and management buttons
- Uses new admin API endpoints for user management

### 5. Admin Page (`app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Added proper authentication checks
- Redirects non-admins with clear error message
- Clean layout with admin dashboard

## Admin Capabilities

### As an Admin, you can now:
1. **User Management**:
   - View all users in the system
   - Promote users to admin or super admin
   - Demote admins back to regular users
   - Delete user accounts

2. **Ticket Management**:
   - View ALL tickets across all organizations
   - Create tickets on behalf of any user
   - Update any ticket (status, priority, assignment, etc.)
   - Delete any ticket
   - Access all voice notes and attachments

3. **Organization Management**:
   - View all organizations
   - Manage organization memberships
   - Update organization settings
   - Delete organizations

4. **System Overview**:
   - Dashboard with comprehensive statistics
   - User counts and role distribution
   - Ticket metrics across the entire system

## How to Activate Admin Permissions

### 1. Run the Database Script
Execute the SQL in `fix-admin-permissions.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor. This will:
- Add the `is_admin` column
- Create admin permission functions
- Set up RLS policies for admin access

### 2. Make Yourself Admin
Run this SQL to make yourself an admin (replace with your email):
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET is_admin = true, is_super_admin = true
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### 3. Access Admin Features
- Navigate to `/admin` for the admin dashboard
- Admin controls are also available in the regular dashboard sidebar
- All admin features are protected by proper authentication

## Security Features

1. **Proper Authentication**: All admin endpoints require valid authentication
2. **RLS Policies**: Database-level security ensures admins can only access what they should
3. **Role Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between regular users, admins, and super admins
4. **API Security**: Admin endpoints check permissions before allowing operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database script to enable admin policies
- [ ] Set yourself as admin in the database
- [ ] Test admin dashboard access at `/admin`
- [ ] Verify you can view all users and tickets
- [ ] Test user role management (promote/demote users)
- [ ] Verify non-admins cannot access admin features
- [ ] Test CRUD operations on tickets from admin interface

Your admin implementation is now complete! You have full CRUD permissions and access to everything in the system.
