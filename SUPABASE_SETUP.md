# Supabase Setup Guide

Your ticket application has been successfully converted to serverless using Supabase! Here's how to set it up:

## 1. Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new project
2. Note down your project URL and API keys

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

Update the `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

## 3. Set up the Database

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Run the script to create all tables, indexes, and policies

## 4. What's Been Converted

### Database Tables Created:
- `tickets` - Main ticket storage with rich text support
- `voice_notes` - Voice recordings linked to tickets
- `drafts` - Auto-saved draft tickets
- `draft_voice_notes` - Voice notes for drafts

### API Endpoints (Next.js App Router):
- `GET/POST /api/tickets` - List and create tickets
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/tickets/[id]` - Individual ticket operations
- `GET/POST /api/drafts` - Draft management
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/drafts/[id]` - Individual draft operations

### Features:
✅ Serverless architecture (no backend server needed)
✅ Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
✅ Voice note uploads to Supabase Storage
✅ Rich text editor with TipTap
✅ Auto-save drafts functionality
✅ Responsive dashboard with filtering
✅ Enterprise-grade security with RLS (Row Level Security)

## 5. Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 6. Key Benefits of Supabase Migration

## 7. Storage Configuration

Voice notes are automatically uploaded to Supabase Storage in the `voice-notes` bucket. The storage policies allow public access for playback.

## 8. Development vs Production

- Development: Uses Supabase development environment
- Production: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify, environment variables automatically picked up

Your application is now fully serverless and ready for production deployment!
