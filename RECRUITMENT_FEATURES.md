## Assignment Logic

### How It Works

1. **Posting Creation**: HR creates an interview posting and selects the target company
2. **Candidate Application**: Candidate applies to the specific posting
3. **Automatic Assignment**:
   - System reads the posting's company information
   - Automatically assigns candidate to that company
   - Sets initial interview status to "pending_schedule"
   - Updates candidate stage to "interview"
4. **Interview Process**: Company-specific interview workflow begins

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **No Manual Errors**: Eliminates human error in candidate routing
- ‚úÖ **Clear Audit Trail**: Full tracking from application to hire
- ‚úÖ **Faster Processing**: Automated workflow reduces time-to-hire

- ‚úÖ **Scalable**: Works with multiple companies and departments
